You can play the game [here][itch].

Other submissions for the jam can be seen [here][submissions] (there were so many amazing entries, please check them out!)

USAFLSCXLV is singleplayer action game where you attempt to score as many touchdowns as you can while avoiding professional football players, navigating a corn maze and also avoiding a combine machine harvesting the maze.
